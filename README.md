## About Me

Hello, my name is Vinicius. I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).

I am part of an embedded systems development group at UNICAMP, the Phoenix Team, and academic week of my course [SECOMP](https://secomp.ic.unicamp.br/). I have a strong interest in low-level computing, especially in areas involving hardware description, microcontroller programming, and embedded systems design. I'm passionate about understanding how things work under the hood, from digital circuits and memory organization to real-time systems and hardware-software integration.

## Areas of Interest

- Computer Architecture
- RISC-V
- FPGA
- Embedded Systems
- Open Source Hardware and Free Software
