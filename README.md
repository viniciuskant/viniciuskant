# About Me
Hello, my name is Vinicius. I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the State University of Campinas (UNICAMP).

I am a student at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), passionate about low-level computing and embedded systems. I have a strong interest in areas involving hardware description, microcontroller programming, and embedded system development. I participate in various academic projects and initiatives that allow me to expand my knowledge and contribute to the community.
## Areas of Interest

- Computer Architecture
- RISC-V
- FPGA
- Embedded Systems
- Open Source Hardware and Free Software


## Organizations and Projects

- **[Odhin Organization](https://github.com/Unicamp-Odhin):** I am an active member of the Odhin organization, which is dedicated to developing innovative solutions focused on high-performance computing and embedded systems.

- **[Rofofo Project - Audio Processing and AI Acceleration with FPGA](https://github.com/Unicamp-Odhin/Rofofo):** I participate in the **Rofofo** project, which aims to accelerate audio processing using FPGAs.

## Other Projects

- **[Green Roofs and Surface Runoff - PIBIC Scientific Initiation](https://github.com/viniciuskant/Telhados-Verdes-Escoamento-Superficial):** This repository contains code developed during my PIBIC scientific initiation. The focus is on the analysis and visualization of hydrological data related to green roofs, a sustainable technology that aims to improve urban drainage and reduce the impact of rainfall in cities.

- **[Termonal - Terminal Game](https://github.com/viniciuskant/termonal):** In my free time, I am creating a terminal game as a hobby. **Termonal** is a simple yet challenging game where players interact through terminal commands.

- **[Custom Kernel - Linux Kernel Modifications](https://github.com/viniciuskant/custom_kernel):** I have made modifications to the Linux kernel to better understand how it works, focusing on the system files part. This project reflects my interest in understanding the internal workings of the operating system and how it interacts with hardware.
